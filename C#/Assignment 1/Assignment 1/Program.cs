    The 00Understanding Data Type.cs is the answer of the question 1 which is "Understanding Data Types" in Introduction to C# and Data Types.


    The 01Playing with Console App.cs is the answer of the question 2 which is "Playing with Console App" in Introduction to C# and Data Types.
    and the class is PlayingwithConSole, method is InputandOput() , and the input is some question.
    

    The 02UnderstandingType.cs is the answer of the question 3 which is "Practice number sizes and ranges" in Introduction to C# and Data Types.

        The answer for  question 2 -1 is the class is NumberSizeandRange_01, and method is Show_the_Type().

        The answer for question 2 - 2 is NumberSizeandRange_01, method is CenturiesConvert, and input is number of CenturiesConvert which is byte type.

    The 03Controlling Flow and Converting Types.cs is the answer of the question 3 which is "Controlling Flow and Converting Types" in Introduction to C# and Data Type.s


    The 04Practice loops and operators.cs is the answer of the question 4 which is "Practice loops and operators" in Introduction to C# and Data Types.

        The answer for Question 4-1-1 is Practiceoloopandoperators, and method is FizzBuzzis().
    
        The answer for Question 4-1-2 can not execute because the WriteLine need to add the classtype in front of WriteLine to become Console.WriteLine. 
        Then it will become infinityloop. it's because the type of max is int, but the type of i is byte. So, i will do cycle from 0 to 255. it will not get 500.
        So, I use the if and gettype to check the initial varialbe and max varialbe are the same type, if they are not throw the exception.

        The answer for question 4-1-3 is the same question 4-3, they both are Practiceoloopandoperators, and method is Guessgame().

        The answer for question 4-2 is Practiceoloopandoperators, method is star(), and parameter is the level which you want to show.

        The Answer for question 4-3 is the same question 4-1-3, they both are Practiceoloopandoperators, and method is Guessgame().

        The answer for question 4-4 is Practiceoloopandoperators, method is Calculatesday(), and Intput is your birthday.

        The answer for question 4-5 is Practiceoloopandoperators, and method is Appropriategreeting().

        The answer for question 4-6 is Practiceoloopandoperators, and method is Fourloop().
