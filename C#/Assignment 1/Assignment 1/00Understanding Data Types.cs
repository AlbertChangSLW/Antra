        2.1 What are the difference between value type and reference type variables?
        Answer : value type hold the value directly, but the reference type variables hold the reference(address) of variables.
                 value type is stored in stack memory, but the reference type variables is stored in heap memory.
                 value type will be collected by garbage collector, but the reference type variable will be collected by garbage collector.
                 value type is created by struct or enum, but the reference type is created by class interface, delegate or array.
                 value type can not be null, but referece variable can be null.
